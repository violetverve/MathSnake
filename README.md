Welcome to MathSnake, an exciting and educational twist on the classic Snake game. Improve your math skills while having fun! This README will guide you through setting up and understanding the game.

## How to Play
MathSnake combines the classic Snake game with math problems. The objective is to eat the apples (represented as numbers) to make your snake grow, but here's the twist: before eating an apple, you must solve the math problem associated with it.

### Controls
Arrow Keys to control the direction of the snake.

### Rules
- Move your snake using the arrow keys.
- Solve a problem presented at the top of the screen and eat the corresponding apple.
- If your answer is correct, the snake eats the apple and grows longer.
- If your answer is wrong, the game is over.
- The game ends when you choose a wrong answer or the snake collides with itself.
- Get the highest score by eating as many apples as possible!
  
## Menu
The Game Menu shows the game's complexity: the range of numbers per action of multiplication/division and addition/subtraction, as well as which are active. It also presents the results of a previous game: its score and best score. The panel below them shows the current configuration of color, speed, and amount of apples-answers spawned per math problem.
